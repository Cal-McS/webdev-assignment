    <h2 class="subheading">Antonine Wall & Roman Fortlet</h2>
    <div class="info_right">
      <p>Bo'ness marks the Eastern-most extent to the Roman Antonine Wall. The remains of the wall travel under Kinneil Estate and there is a ruined Roman fortlet which was located on the wall. An exhibition can be found in Kinneil museum which shows what the wall may have looked like and the path of the wall. The Bridgeness Slab was erected by the Romans to mark the completion of the Antonine Wall. While the original is in the Edinburgh museum, a replica stands in place today.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Bo'ness Mines</h2>
    <div class="info_left">
      <p>Bo'ness is an old coal mining town. There is a memorial of the mineshaft wheel in Bo'ness centre and another memorial located on the shore that depicts a tunnel. The mining was conducted in a tunnel that reached into Fife. It was known for having a very poor treatment of the miners who would often get caught in tunnel collapses. The mines officially shut down in 1983 and remain an important part of the town's history.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Docks</h2>
    <div class="info_right">
      <p>The Bo'ness docks used to be the main pathway for coal trade in Bo'ness. It also played a part in the whaling industry in the 18th century and became a large importer of pit props from Scandinavia in the 19th century. The docks were used as a temporary naval base of operations during both world wars which contributed to the collapse of trade in and out of the docks. The docks closed on June 30 1959.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Clay Mines</h2>
    <div class="info_left">
      <p>The Bo'ness clay mines had been in operation since the 19th century and contributed to the pottery industry in the town. Bo'ness has a rich deposit of fire clay due to fire clay often being found close to coal mine deposits. Production in the clay mines reached a peak in the 1950s and the tunnels reached 10km long by the 1970s. The mines closed permanently in 2013 and there is very little that remains of the mines.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Ironworks</h2>
    <div class="info_right">
      <p>Bo'ness has a worldwide history with the Ballantine ironworks plant. Products made by the plant can be found all over the world from drain covers to bridge supports, including replica cannons for Edinburgh castle. Major bridges along the Thames river were fabricated by the ironworks in the 1900s. To this day the ironworks remains a major form of industry in Bo'ness.</p>
