The colours of the website were picked to match the town's most commonly associated colours (blue, red, yellow and black) with more of a focus on the blue.
The design was chosen as it shows features of the town clearly and is made to look professional and have a good balance across the page.
The navigation bar was placed at the bottom of the page so as to avoid interfering with the information on each page while still being easy to follow.
The biggest challenge was the banner images as I really struggled to figure out how to make them work side by side.
I did not manage to make bootstrap features work, however, I did my best to make the website as responsive and compatible as possible.
